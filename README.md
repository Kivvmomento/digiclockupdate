# digiclockupdate
 this is an updated version

 a simple digital clock web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time, date, and a day/night indicator. The project is open-source and free to use for anyone interested in creating a similar clock.


How to use
To use the digital clock, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The clock should start running and displaying the current time.

How it works
The digital clock is created using HTML, styled with CSS, and powered by JavaScript. The HTML file contains three div elements with unique IDs: clock, day-night-indicator, and date. The CSS file styles these elements to create the visual appearance of the clock.

The JavaScript code is responsible for updating the clock every second. It uses the built-in Date() object to get the current time and date, then formats the data into a human-readable string. The code also determines whether it is currently day or night, and updates the day-night-indicator element accordingly.

How to contribute
